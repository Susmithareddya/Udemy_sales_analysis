# Udemy_sales_analysis
In this analysis, I explored the Udemy courses dataset from Kaggle to gain insights into the platform's performance. I investigated the relationship between various course attributes and the number of subscribers, including the effect of discounts, number of lectures, and course duration. Additionally, I examined the correlation between the number of reviews and subscribers to understand how user feedback influences course popularity. Visualizations were created to aid in understanding these relationships. The findings suggest that offering discounts is a useful strategy for attracting more users to the platform, and courses with higher numbers of reviews tend to have higher numbers of subscribers.
